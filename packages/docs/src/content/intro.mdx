ISOS aims to produce accessible HTML documents from LaTeX and Quarto Markdown documents. Upon opening a `.tex` or `.qmd` file with the program, it will display preview of the resulting HTML file. It will also watch the file so each time it's saved the preview will refresh, which should facilitate speedy amendments. When you're ready, you can save the HTML file. The HTML file that is saved, should be exactly what you see in the ISOS preview, minus the black bar along the top.

Converting LaTeX to HTML isn't always straightforward, because the two technologies are fundamentally different. This project doesn't aim to provide a seamless conversion of all LaTeX to HTML. Instead, it hopes to support a subset of LaTeX commands and packages. What ISOS supports is outlined in this page.
