ISOS aims to produce accessible HTML documents from [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) Markdown documents. Upon opening a `.tex` or `.qmd` file with the program, it will display preview of the resulting HTML file. It will also watch the file so each time it's saved the preview will refresh, which should facilitate speedy amendments. When you're ready, you can save the HTML file. The HTML file that is saved, should be exactly what you see in the ISOS preview, minus the black bar along the top.

Converting LaTeX to HTML isn't always straightforward, because the two technologies are fundamentally different. This project doesn't aim to provide a seamless conversion of all LaTeX to HTML. Instead, it hopes to support a subset of LaTeX commands and packages. What ISOS supports is outlined below.

### Implementation details

ISOS currently consists of 3 sub-projects: a LaTeX-to-Quarto-Markdown processor, a Quarto-Markdown-to-[MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) processor, and a runtime package with responsive styling and accessibility options. The processor parts are built on top of the [unified.js](https://unifiedjs.com/) ecosystem of packages, which provide various tools to help parse and manipulate syntax. ISOS is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and is isomorphic, meaning (when bundled to JavaScript), it can run in a browser or in a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) environment, making it very flexible.

When you save an HTML file with ISOS, the HTML file contains the Quarto Markdown content, the Quarto-Markdown-to-MDX processor, and the runtime package. This provides several advantages over existing tools, such as AST manipulation in the browser for total control, and providing the Markdown source content in every distributable copy. Markdown is arguably the simplest, most stripped back version of a technical document1, and can be converted to almost any alternative format using free tools, so including it in the distributable file should help mitigate delays in finding source material, should someone need additional customisations.

ISOS uses a project called [Tauri](https://v2.tauri.app/) to turn a browser-based project into a native app, so what you see when using ISOS is an HTML webpage displayed with your OSes built-in browser. However there are some drawbacks to using the OSes built-in browser for this project, the main one being it's only possible to programmatically ask a browser to print using a Chromium-based browser, and this is how ISOS intends to output a PDF (the Save as PDF feature). For now, this is possible by manually opening the resulting HTML file in your (ideally Chromium/Chrome browser), select print, and save as PDF. In the near future ISOS will likely replace Tauri with [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a similar project which bundles Chromium inside the installer.

Although ISOS supports Quarto's flavour of Markdown syntax, it currently doesn't execute code chunks as Quarto does. ISOS aims to allow users to first use Quarto for code execution only (using the [--keep-md](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html#intermediates) option), then convert the resulting Quarto Markdown to HTML with ISOS.

The code snippets in the documentation below use the current latest version of ISOS: LaTeX code snippets are provided, and ISOS converts them to Quarto Markdown and then to HTML, so (in theory at least) you can be confident that if you copy-paste code from here, it will run in your project.
