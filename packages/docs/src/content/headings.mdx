## Headings

In HTML, there is the concept of 6 heading levels, represented as `<h1>` to `<h6>`. In accessible HTML guidelines, it's usually recommended that there be only one `<h1>` in a document, and to avoid skipping heading ranks (for example, make sure that an `<h2>` is not followed directly by an `<h4>`).

In the HTML file produced by ISOS, there is a table of contents in the sidebar to help users easily navigate around large documents. This table of contents is generated from the `<h2>`'s and `<h3>`'s in the document.

You many need to adjust your LaTeX section titles in order for this table of contents to render correctly.

Here is how ISOS maps LaTeX sections and HTML headings:

| HTML | LaTeX          |
| ---- | -------------- |
| h1   | \title         |
| h2   | \section       |
| h3   | \subsection    |
| h4   | \subsubsection |
| h5   | \paragraph     |
| h6   | \subparagraph  |

Headings have counters which match default `pdflatex` behaviour:

<CodeSnippet
  latex={String.raw`
    \title{Alpha}
    \section{Bravo}
    \subsection{Charlie}
    \subsubsection{Delta}
    \paragraph{Echo}
    \subparagraph{Foxtrot}
  `}
/>
