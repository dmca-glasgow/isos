## Referencing

ISOS follows the referencing approach used by Quarto, and generates descriptive labels for references automatically. This can be replicated in LaTeX with the `cleveref` package. ISOS creates HTML anchor links for all references, but if you'd like to add anchor links to your `pdflatex` PDF too, it also plays nicely with the `hyperref` package.

<SyntaxHighlight
  language="latex"
  code={String.raw`
    \usepackage[noabbrev, capitalise, nameinlink]{cleveref}
    % this is optional and only affects the PDF generated by pdflatex
    \usepackage{hyperref}
  `}
/>

This configuration is important to specify as-is in your preamble because we rely on the automatic label generation provided, otherwise you will end up with double labels when conventionally using `\ref`.

Quarto (and ISOS) derive labels from the label prefix. Here is a list of available prefixes and their labels:

| Prefix | Label       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| thm    | Theorem     |
| lem    | Lemma       |
| cor    | Corollary   |
| prp    | Proposition |
| cnj    | Conjecture  |
| def    | Definition  |
| sol    | Solution    |
| rem    | Remark      |
| eq     | Equation    |
| fig    | Figure      |
| tbl    | Table       |
| sec    | Section     |

Here is an example of something being referenced using `\cref`:

<CodeSnippet
  latex={String.raw`
    \subsection{Charlie} \label{sec:charlie}

    Refer to \cref{sec:charlie}.

`}
/>

It appears in some cases (for `eq` and `tbl`), `\cref` should be replaced with `\autoref` to render correctly with `pdflatex`, but both are interchangeable in ISOS:

<CodeSnippet
  latex={String.raw`
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq:myref}
    x^2 - 5 x + 6 = 0
    \end{equation}

    Refer to \autoref{eq:myref}.
