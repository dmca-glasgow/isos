ISOS follows the referencing approach used by Quarto, and generates descriptive labels for references automatically. This can be replicated in LaTeX with the `cleveref` package:

<SyntaxHighlight
  language="latex"
  code={String.raw`
    \usepackage[noabbrev, capitalise, nameinlink]{cleveref}
  `}
/>

This configuration is important to specify as-is in your preamble. `cleveref` exposes two macros which are picked up and processed by ISOSâ€” `\cref` and `\autoref`. The `\ref` macro is explicitly unsupported (ISOS will warn you and not process the reference) because it's likely to lead to unintentional double labels in your document.

ISOS (and `cleveref` and Quarto) derive labels from the label prefix. Here is a table of known prefixes and their labels:

| Prefix | Label       |
| ------ | ----------- |
| sec    | Section     |
| eq     | Equation    |
| fig    | Figure      |
| tbl    | Table       |
| thm    | Theorem     |
| lem    | Lemma       |
| cor    | Corollary   |
| prp    | Proposition |
| cnj    | Conjecture  |
| def    | Definition  |
| exm    | Example     |
| exr    | Exercise    |
| sol    | Solution    |
| rem    | Remark      |

For example:

<CodeSnippet latex={String.raw`
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage[noabbrev, capitalise, nameinlink]{cleveref}
\begin{document}

\section{Bravo}
\label{sec:bravo}

My section.

Refer to \cref{sec:bravo} for more information.

\end{document}
`} />

With ISOS you may also define custom theorems which are automatically labelled when referenced. See the theorems section for more information.
